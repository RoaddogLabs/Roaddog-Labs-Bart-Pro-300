## Roaddog Labs Bart Pro 300
## 
This is the Roaddog Bart Pro 300 3D printer. This machine is a larger build
based on a mashup implemented from several designs including original
designs.  


#####Bart Pro 300 uses high performance lead screws, M10 precision shaft on all axis, high temp hot end suitable to 400*C, auto bed probe (bed leveling), silcone bed heater, MIC 6 precision aluminum print surface with PEI.

### This is a pre release version
### 
The current version is a pre release.  While the machine is functional
and works well, it's still a work in progress.  There are not build docs at this point, refer to Bart Pro XL build docs at http://roaddoglabs.io/wiki/Roaddog_Labs_Bart_Pro_XL

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged.
